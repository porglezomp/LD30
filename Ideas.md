Theme: Connected Worlds
-----------------------

- Should be simple puzzle game
    - Only mouse clicks, so it can be ported to mobile

Just go with this one, I think
------------------------------

- Tile game, like bejeweled
    - Two (more?) worlds, each one has different rules for combining items
    - Big combos when the worlds switch
    - Could be made all juicy and stuff
    - Simple?

- I can't make multiple ideas, can I?

Go think outside the computer
